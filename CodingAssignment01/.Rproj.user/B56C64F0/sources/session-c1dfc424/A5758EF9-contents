A Florida health insurance company wants to predict annual claims for individual clients. The company pulls a random sample of 100 customers. The owner wishes to charge an actuarially fair premium to ensure a normal rate of return. The owner collects all of their current customer’s health care expenses from the last year and compares them with what is known about each customer’s plan. 

The data on the 100 customers in the sample is as follows:

-	Charges: Total medical expenses for a particular insurance plan (in dollars)
-	Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
-	BMI: Primary beneficiary’s body mass index (kg/m2)
-	Female: Primary beneficiary’s birth sex (0 = Male, 1 = Female)
-	Children: Number of children covered by health insurance plan (includes other dependents as well)
-	Smoker: Indicator if primary beneficiary is a smoker (0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker)
-	Cities: Dummy variables for each city with the default being Sanford

Answer the following questions using complete sentences and attach all output, plots, etc. within this report.


**For this assignment, ignore the categorical variables (gender, smoker, cities)**

```{r dataset, include=FALSE}

InsuranceData <- read_csv("C:/UserData/z002r7kt/OneDrive - Siemens AG/Reference Documents/Learnings/Fall-24_ECO6416_Group6/Insurance_Data_Group6.csv")


```



# Question 1

Perform univariate analyses on the quantitative variables (center, shape, spread). Include descriptive statistics, and histograms. Be sure to use terms discussed in class such as bimodal, skewed left, etc.

```{r q1}
##Modes

getModes <- function(x) {
ux <- unique(x)
tab <- tabulate(match(x, ux))
ux[tab == max(tab)]
}

getModes(InsuranceData$Age)
getModes(InsuranceData$BMI)
getModes(InsuranceData$Children)


#Spread

sd(InsuranceData$Age)
sd(InsuranceData$BMI)
sd(InsuranceData$Children)

#Center
summary(InsuranceData$Age)
summary(InsuranceData$BMI)
summary(InsuranceData$Children)

#Shape

hist(InsuranceData$Age)
hist(InsuranceData$BMI)
hist(InsuranceData$Children)
```


### **Uni-variate Analysis:**

- For the variable Age, mean __`r mean(InsuranceData$Age)`__ is greater than its median __`r median(InsuranceData$Age)`__ thus it is right skewed. Hence, mean is no longer a good measure of center for the uni variate analysis using the variable Age, instead median should be used. 

- For the variables BMI & Children, mean are approximately equal to their median thus they are symmetric, however, since the variable is BMI multi-modal and Children doesn't contain any mode, they are not normal distribution and cannot use mean and standard deviation. 

*****

# Question 2

Perform bivariate analyses on the quantitative variables (direction, strength and form). Describe the linear association between all variables. 

```{r q2}
cor(InsuranceData[c("Charges","Age", "BMI", "Children")])
corrplot(cor(InsuranceData[c("Charges","Age", "BMI", "Children")]))
scatterplotMatrix(InsuranceData[c("Charges","Age", "BMI", "Children")])
```

### **Bi-variate Analysis:**

- The variable BMI has strong positive liner, Age has moderate positive linear and Children has weak positive linear correlation with the variable Charges.

*****

# Question 3
#Generate a regression equation in the following form:

$$Charges = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}*Age+\beta_{2}*BMI+\beta_{3}*Children$$

```{r q3}

model <- lm(Charges ~ Age + BMI + Children, data = InsuranceData)

summary(model)

```

also write out the regression cleanly in this document.

**The regression equation written clearly: Charges = -12798.79 + 186.99(Age) + 625.41(BMI) - 101.33(Children)**


*****

# Question 4

An eager insurance representative comes back with a potential client. The client is 40, their BMI is 30, and they have one dependent. Using the regression equation above, predict the amount of medical expenses associated with this policy. (Provide a 95% confidence interval as well)


```{r q4}
newPrediction <- data.frame(Age = 40, 
                         BMI = 30, 
                         Children = 1)

predict(model ,newdata = newPrediction, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)
```
